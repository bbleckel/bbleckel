## Bo Bleckel

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page. Here I have a few of my personal projects that I've worked on over the years.

### About me
I am a former educator exploring careers and opportunities in software and data science. 
I have experience in machine learning, data visualization, and object oriented programming. 
I am particularly interested in machine learning ethics and education as well as data-driven story telling.

[My resume can be found here](https://github.com/bbleckel/resume/raw/master/bleckel_resume.pdf).

I live in Somerville, MA, studied in Maine, and grew up in Hawaii.
