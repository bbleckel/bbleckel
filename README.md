## Bo Bleckel

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page. Here I have a few of my personal projects that I've worked on over the years.

### About me
I am a former educator exploring careers and opportunities in software and data science. 
I have experience in machine learning, data visualization, and object oriented programming. 
I am particularly interested in machine learning ethics, ML ethics, and 
computer science education as well as data-driven story telling.

[My resume can be found here](https://github.com/bbleckel/resume/blob/master/bleckel_resume.pdf).

I live in Somerville, MA, studied in Maine, and grew up in Hawaii.

### Highlights
A few highlights of the projects on my GitHub page:
* [Recreating Images with Triangles that Evolve!](https://github.com/bbleckel/Final-Project) - A project exploring the possiblities of using genetic algorithms combined with particle swarm optimization to recreate images using "smart" triangles. 
* [Visualization of ecological breakdown of areas surrounding lakes in the northeast](https://web.bowdoin.edu/~lbleckel/FinalProject/map.html) - A project from college that displays use of D3 and web design abilities as well as collaborative capabilities.
* [NNLA](https://github.com/bbleckel/NNLA) - A brief exploration of single layer perceptrons using matrices
* [ACO-TSP](https://github.com/bbleckel/ACO-TSP-2017) - A project from "Nature Inspired Computation" to solve the traveling salesperson problem using Ant Colony Optimization
* [PSO-Neighborhoods](https://github.com/bbleckel/PSO-Neighborhoods-2017) - A project exploring the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for heuristic multi-dimensional optimization.
* [GA-MAXSAT](https://github.com/bbleckel/MAXSAT-2017) - A project using Genetic Algorithms to solve MAXSAT problems.
