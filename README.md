## Bo Bleckel

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub page. Here I have a few of my personal projects that I've worked on over the years.

### About me
I am a former educator exploring careers and opportunities in software and data science. 
I have experience in machine learning, data visualization, and object oriented programming. 
I am particularly interested in machine learning ethics and education as well as data-driven story telling.

### Highlights
A few highlights of the projects on my GitHub page:
* [NNLA](https://github.com/bbleckel/NNLA) - A brief exploration of single layer perceptrons using matrices
* [ACO-TSP](https://github.com/bbleckel/ACO-TSP-2017) - A project from "Nature Inspired Computation" to solve the traveling salesperson problem using Ant Colony Optimization
* [PSO-Neighborhoods](https://github.com/bbleckel/PSO-Neighborhoods-2017) - A project from exploring the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for heuristic multi-dimensional optimization.
* [GA-MAXSAT](https://github.com/bbleckel/MAXSAT-2017) - A project using Genetic Algorithms to solve MAXSAT problems.
